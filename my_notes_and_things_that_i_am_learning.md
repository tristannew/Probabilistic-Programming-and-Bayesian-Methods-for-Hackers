1. Prior probability and posterior probabilty are prior to and posteriro to you learning stuff. Before I know anything about how often externalities are internalised, I have a prior belief that the probaility of it follows a Gamma distribution. So I choose a Gamma prior. When I learn that out of 100 companies, 20 internalise an externality, I can update my prior beliefs and get a posteriro probability. I can then use that posterior probability as my prior beliefs in the next model run.
